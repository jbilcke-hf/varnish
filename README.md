# Varnish ðŸ’…

## What is Varnish?

Varnish is a library to add some flair to sequence of frames generated with AI video models, to turn them into nice MP4 video files, with precise control over the compression levels, framerate, film grain noise.

It can handle frame upscaling and frame interpolation.

## Funding

VideoModelStudio is 100% open-source project, this is a project I really develop just for myself initially, for my Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.

I'm more or less the only user so I maintain it on my personal time, so if you like it let me know ðŸ«¶
